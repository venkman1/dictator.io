O great people, O valiant fighters in our heroic armed forces, peace be upon you.

"Now we are living through decisive days in which fighters and the great Iraqi people are doing exceptionally well and for which they deserve victory and satisfaction from God -- as He promised the true faithful against the enemies of God and humanity.

"It is our right, nay our duty, to be proud as fighting believers who are patient in this epic war...

"We have always complied, even with what is illegitimate and unjust among the demands and allegations of the evil ones, in the hope that the world would awake and lift the sanctions against our people and so that we avoid the evils of war.

"And after they ran out of excuses or cover, the invading aggressors came openly and shamelessly with vicious intent as we know them and their intentions to be.

"And here you are today standing, o valiant Iraqis, glorious women and brave armed forces, in a manner which pleases friends and the faithful and enrages the enemies and infidels. A stand which will make you victorious, God willing, against your enemies...

"Everyone can see the aggression and injustice and those who were deceived globally by the enemies during and after 1991 have awoken with the general awareness of humanity and the sons of our nation. I herald the near-victory for our patient fighters. These are decisive days, O Iraqis, so attack as God ordered.

"Therefore, after underestimating you...the enemy is trapped in the sacred land of Iraq which is being defended by its great people and army.

"O brave fighters, hit your enemy with all your strength. O Iraqis, fight with the strength of the spirit of jihad (holy war) which you carry in you and push them to the point where they cannot go on."

"You (fighters) will reap stability and dignity with victory. For our martyrs the prize of heaven and for you the prize of honour which satisfies God and which will be recorded by history. The lesson you teach the enemy will make them think twice, and even be incapable, of attacking you, your nation and humanity again."

Oh Arabs, oh faithful of the world, oh those who support justice and oppose evil, we herald the victory that God has promised us in the conflict against the lowlifes and enemies of humanity.
